\section{Introduction}
    \subsection{Context}
    % Briefly explain what visual field mapping is and why it's important, especially in the context of VR.
    Visual field testing is to chart the visual field of a patient, to find blind spots and blurry spots of vision. Can use that data to construct a visual field map which is in the brain, and from there diagnose possible defects in the visual pathway or even in the visual cortex of the brain.
    
    But VFT have not changed much, and with upcoming VR headset technology which mainly focus on the eyes, can create a easy to distribute, and easy to use but still relatively accurate VFT using VR.
    \subsection{Objective}
    Purpose of report is to, identify current visual field technologies, and subsequently research gaps in said subjects
    
    Find trends and methodologies other researchers have used, and plan to implement them in my project.
    
    % State the purpose of report, such as identifying trends, key methodologies, and research gaps in visual field mapping using VR.
    \subsection{Scope}
    % Mention the criteria for paper selection and briefly explain triage process (e.g., focusing on abstracts, introductions, and conclusions).
    Criteria of paper selections into scope: Keywords in titles, References by past works on similar project work. 
    

\section{Methodology}
    \subsection{Selection Criteria and Triage}
     % Explain how I chose the papers (e.g., keywords, relevance to VR and visual field mapping).
     Start of by searching on google scholar keywords such as Visual Field Testing, VR etc, and reading the titles of the papers, Only clicking in on those that shows relevancy to my subject. Then read through the abstract further refine the choices of papers. After reading through the abstract, take note of those that have higher relevance or those which shows promising info on my subject. These will be selected to be read through more in depth, such as the introductions and discussions and conclusions

    Also take notes of research papers cited by papers that I have read and deemed significant to my subject.
    % \subsection{Triage}
    % Briefly describe my approach, such as reading abstracts for relevance and then delving into details if the paper fits.

        \subsubsection{Reliability of Visual Field Results over Repeated                    Testing}
            Author: Joanne Katz*
            Year: 1991  
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Objective: Examine whether the reliability of automated perimetry improves with yearly testing.
                \item Methodology: Conducted study on self-referred subjects at yearly intervals.
                \item Key Findings: Found that 35\% of patients
                with ocular hypertension had unreliable results on initial testing and that the proportion declined to 26\%.
                \item Relevance: To support the basis of easy repeatable testing that comes with a deployed accessible VR application.
